# Minestom Server Template

A very simple implementation of Minestom, which can be used as a template to develop your own
server. The project structure allows to create a separate API at the same time, which can be
released apart from the actual server.

## Specification

Apart from the fact that this project serves as a template, it can be run and used as a server. You
can either [build from source](https://github.com/Koboo/TemplateStom/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or
download the [latest release](https://github.com/Koboo/TemplateStom/releases/latest).

* JDK: ``Java 17``
* Minecraft-Version: ``1.18.2``
* Gradle: ``7.2``

## Features

* ``stop``-Command to stop the server (Permission: ``command.stop``)
* ``version``-Command to show current server version
* Asynchronous writing of log-files
* [ColorCode](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes) support in the Console
* Proxy support (BungeeCord, Waterfall, Velocity)
* Structure to publish separate API
* YAML configuration file (``server_config.yml``)

## Publishing

If the API should be published via ``maven-publish``, it's [build.gradle](server-api/build.gradle)
must be modified accordingly.

## Server Configuration

This is the default configuration when the server gets started for the first time:

````yaml
server:
  # The host address of the server
  host: 0.0.0.0
  # The listening port of the server
  port: 25568
  # Toggle online-mode (mojang authentication) of the server
  online-mode: true
  # Toggle difficulty (options: PEACEFUL, EASY, NORMAL, HARD)
  difficulty: NORMAL
  # Toggle gamemode (options: CREATIVE, SURVIVAL, ADVENTURE, SPECTATOR)
  gamemode: SURVIVAL
proxy:
  # Toggle proxy-mode (options: NONE, BUNGEECORD, VELOCITY)
  proxy-mode: NONE
  # Set your velocity-secret (Do not share that!)
  velocity-secret: ''
packets:
  # Set the rate-limit of packets/second for the clients (0 disables rate-limit)
  rate-limit: 450
  # Set the max-size of packets from the clients (maximum is 2097151 bytes)
  max-size: 2097151
  # Set the compression-threshold of packets (0 disables compression)
  compression-threshold: ''
view-distance:
  # Set the view-distance of chunks (range between 2 and 32)
  chunks: 10
  # Set the view-distance of entities (range between 2 and 32)
  entities: 10

to be applied.**
